# Islamic Inheritance Calculator in C

## Overview
This project implements an Islamic Law-based Inheritance Distribution System in C. It calculates shares of heirs based on gender, relationships, and presence of relatives. It handles complex cases such as:

- Awl Cases (when fixed shares exceed total estate)
- Residue Distribution (Radd)
- No Heir Scenarios
- Distant Relatives Distribution

## Features
- Centered UI boxes for clarity
- Fully interactive CLI
- Handles almost all Faraid scenarios
